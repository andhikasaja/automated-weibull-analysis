# Project Maturity

The functionality implemented herein is accurate to the best of my ability, but you should head on over to [reliability](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more feature-rich and better-maintained project.

```diff
- This project will not have future revision and 
- you should refactor your code accordingly.  I 
- have included an import warning in `v0.1.3`.

# Contributions
